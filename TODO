Features:
---------

- In multiple image mode, allow to save and export only the current image
  (use KFileDialog(url, filter, parent, widget) where widget is a checkbox).
  This is already the case for all exports except "Export to PDF" because
  that's the only thing that works.

- Allow loading commands from user specified files. This is useful for
  allowing commands from the TikZ libraries to be highlighted.

- Implement a fancier tikz command insertion mechanism (e.g. like in
  QtCreator).

- Clicking an item in the TikZ commands dock widget should not insert
  it, but only select it.  Pressing an Insert button would then do the
  actual insertion.  There should also be a Help button which opens the
  TikZ manual at the page where the selected item is explained.

- Make a graphical tool for editing the XML file containing the TikZ
  commands similar to keditbookmarks

- Create a new process for each window opened by the "New" action.
  Is that really necessary?

- Download files which are \included or \inputted in remote template files
  or remote pgf files to the temporary directory (could be dangerous when
  the user is still editing the \input command).
  No, don't do that, find a better way to handle this.

- Add support for tabs in the editor. Multiple tabs with single preview widget.

Bugs or shortcomings:
---------------------

- Make sure that all strings in the kpart are translated.

- In common/tikzpreviewcontroller.cpp find a better way to print the image.
